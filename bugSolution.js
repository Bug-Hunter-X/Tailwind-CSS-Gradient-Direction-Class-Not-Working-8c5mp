// Possible solution, verifying the correct usage of the gradient direction class and that there are no conflicting styles.
<div className="bg-gradient-to-r from-blue-500 via-teal-500 to-purple-500 p-4 rounded-lg">
  {/* Content here */}
</div>

//Another possible solution if the issue persists after verifying the above, it might be a bug with the specific version or configuration of Tailwind CSS. Check for updates or consider opening an issue on the Tailwind CSS repository
