# Tailwind CSS Gradient Direction Issue

This repository demonstrates a potential issue with Tailwind CSS gradient direction classes.  The gradient isn't correctly rendering the specified direction, resulting in unexpected visual output.

## Bug Description
The `bg-gradient-to-r` class, which should create a horizontal gradient, isn't functioning correctly in certain contexts.  This could be due to conflicting styles or other unforeseen issues.

## Solution
The solution involves verifying that there aren't any conflicting CSS rules overriding the Tailwind CSS classes and checking the Tailwind CSS configuration to ensure the plugin is correctly installed and functioning.  This solution also includes a possible fix if the issue arises from incorrect usage of the gradient class.
